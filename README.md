# CSS-Gallery
üñºÔ∏è CSS Image Gallery Collection
Designed three distinct, responsive image galleries using HTML and CSS: a simple grid, a Lightbox-style layout, and a horizontal slider gallery. This project strengthened my understanding of flexbox, grid systems, media queries, and responsive design principles. It also gave me hands-on experience in building visually appealing and adaptable UI components for modern web interfaces.
